# Image_Text_Searching_Script
Here I have made a Python script which can be used when you have a big collection or gallery of images and you're sure that you have to find a screenshot of a LinkedIn post where its mentioned about a Mechanical Engineering Project then with the help of this script you can easily find the image as soon as you write the thing which you want to search and you hit GO!


This is a very small but very useful project which can be used by almost all the people. As it becomes very tough job to find something from 100s of images, this project comes as a life saviour. 


This project was made by me when I was facing problem in finding an image which was basically a screen shot of a railway ticket. So I made this application and when I filled the station name, I got the ticket.

We have an Image gallery where there are lots of pictures and in one of them Datacamp is written. For this case we are using datacamp as an example and we are going to find this image from the batch of images.

When we call the python script, firstly we have to chose the image directory where the gallery of images are stored.

Now as we have to search for DataCamp we write it in the field.

After few minutes.... Voila! we get the image opened infront of us.
