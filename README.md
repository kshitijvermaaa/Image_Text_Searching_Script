# Image_Text_Searching_Script
Here I have made a Python script where when you have a big collection or gallery of images and you're sure that you have to find a screenshot of a LinkedIn post where its mentioned about a Mechanical Engineering Project then with the help of this script you can easily find the image as soon as you write the thing which you want to search and you hit GO!
